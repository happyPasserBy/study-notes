         *               on failure, block.
         *   CANCELLED:  This node is cancelled due to timeout or interrupt.
         *               Nodes never leave this state. In particular,
         *               a thread with cancelled node never again blocks.

         *               It will not be used as a sync queue node

         *               nothing to do with the other uses of the
         *               field, but simplifies mechanics.)
         *   PROPAGATE:  A releaseShared should be propagated to other
         *               nodes. This is set (for head node only) in
         *               doReleaseShared to ensure propagation
         *               continues, even if other operations have
         *               since intervened.
         *   0:          None of the above
         *
         * The values are arranged numerically to simplify use.
         * Non-negative values mean that a node doesn't need to
         * signal. So, most code doesn't need to check for particular
         * values, just for sign.

            //你对外宣布自己是单身状态，但是实际和刘宏斌私下约会；这有点坑人
            //所以只能先park；在改状态；但是问题你自己都park了；完全释放CPU资源了，故而没有办法执行任何代码了，
            //所以只能别人来改；故而可以看到每次都是自己的后一个节点把自己改成-1状态
